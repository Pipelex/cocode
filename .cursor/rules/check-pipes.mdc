This rule automates checking the pipes all lint and load properly.

When you modify the pipeline .plx files and/or the structures in the *.py files of the pipelex_libraries, you must check that they load properly.
Do the following:
1- Call `cocode validate`
2- Fetch logs from the console
3- Fix linting or validation issues
