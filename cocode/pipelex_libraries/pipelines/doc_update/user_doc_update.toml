Analyze this git diff to identify changes that need docs/ directory updates:

@git_diff

ONLY identify changes that clearly affect users, such as:
- New CLI commands or removed commands
- Changed command behavior or parameters
- New features users will interact with
- Installation/setup changes
- API changes that affect user code

EXCLUDE:
- Internal refactoring
- Test changes
- Implementation details
- Minor version bumps without feature changes
- Code reorganization that doesn't affect user interface
- AI-specific tools or workflows (these belong in AI instruction files)

For each change that needs user documentation, provide:
- File path where the change occurred
- Type of change (new feature, removed feature, changed behavior, etc.)
- Brief description of what changed
- Why users need to know about this

Be conservative - when in doubt, don't include it.
