Here is a description of the pipes:
We have pipe controllers:
- PipeLLM: A pipe that uses an LLM to generate a text, or a structured object. It is a vision LLM that can read images.
  CRITICAL: When extracting MULTIPLE items (articles, employees, products), use multiple_output = true with SINGULAR concepts!
  - Create concept "Article" (not "Articles") with fields "item_name", "quantity" (not "item_names", "quantities")
  - Then set multiple_output = true to get a list of Article objects
- PipeSequence: A pipe that executes a sequence of pipes: It needs to reference the pipes it will execute.
- PipeParallel: A pipe that executes a few pipes in parallel. It needs to reference the pipes it will execute. The results of each pipe will be in the working memory. The output MUST BE "Dynamic".
- PipeCondition: A pipe that based on a specific condition, branches to a specific pipe. You have to explain what the expression of the condition is,
    and what the different pipes are that can be executed based on the condition. It needs to reference the pipes it will execute.
- PipeBatch: A pipe that executes a batch of pipes in parallel. It needs to reference the pipe it will execute.
- PipeImgGen: A pipe that uses an LLM to generate an image. VERY IMPORTANT: IF YOU DECIDE TO CREATE A PIPEIMGEN, YOU ALSO HAVE TO CREATE A PIPELLM THAT WILL WRITE THE PROMPT, AND THAT NEEDS TO PRECEED THE PIPEIMGEN, based on the necessary elements.
That means that in the MAIN pipeline, the prompt should NOT be an input. It should be a step that generates the prompt.
- PipeOcr: A pipe that uses an OCR technology to extract text from an image.
VERY IMPORTANT: THE INPUT OF THE PIPEOCR MUST BE either an image or a pdf or a concept which refines one of them.

Be very detailed, process by steps.

You will receive a plan for a Pipelex pipeline.
Each pipeline will take inputs and output. Those inputs/output are represented as concepts.

Return ConceptSpecsText capturing all concepts used in the plan:
- Use PascalCase for concept codes
- Provide a short description per concept
- Include structure hints as plain text (fields, types) IF IT IS needed.

CRITICAL RULE: Concepts must represent SINGLE ENTITIES, never collections!
- Create "Article" not "Articles"
- Create "Employee" not "Employees"
- Use SINGULAR field names: "item_name" not "item_names", "quantity" not "quantities"
- If you need multiple items, the PipeLLM will use multiple_output=true to generate a LIST of the concept

If you need structure for your concept, to isolate/extract some precise information, assign a structure:
Here is how the structure as to be described:
A dict with:
- key: the field name in snake_case (ALWAYS SINGULAR)
- value: a dict with:
  - definition: the definition of the field, in natural language
  - type: the type of the field (text, integer, boolean, number)
  - required: whether the field is required
  - default_value: the default value of the field

You can have multiple fields if needed, but each field should represent a single value.

Otherwise, there are native concepts that you can use:
If the concept you want to create is JUST a text, assign "Text" to the 'refines' field, and no structure field.
If the concept you want to create is JUST an image, assign "Image" to the 'refines' field, and no structure field.
If the concept you want to create is JUST a PDF, assign "PDF" to the 'refines' field, and no structure field.
If the concept you want to create is JUST a Number, assign "Number" to the 'refines' field, and no structure field.

DO NOT redefine native concepts:
- Text
- Image
- PDF
- Number
- Page
If you need one of these, you will later on use them, but you should NOT REDEFINE THEM.

Return PipeSignaturesText listing every pipe to build:
- For each pipe: give a unique snake_case pipe_code, type, definition, inputs (by concept code/name), output, and important_features
- Controller pipes must reference children by their codes consistently
- The Pipe Controllers, if they mention pipes, they should always mention existing pipes.
- Add as much details as possible for the description.

Here are the ESSENTIAL features for each pipe type that should be included in important_features (only include these key ones):

**PipeLLM**: A pipe that uses an LLM to generate a text, or a structured object. It is a vision LLM that can read images.
The inputs of the PipeLLM should be:
The variables tagged in the prompt template (with $ or @). If there are no variables, the inputs should be empty.
The ouput should be the concept code of the output
- prompt_template: The prompt template with variable substitution ($ for inline, @ for blocks)
- multiple_output: true if generating multiple number of outputs: That means it will output a LIST of the CONCEPT!

CRITICAL RULE FOR PIPELLM:
- If extracting MULTIPLE items (like multiple articles, employees, products), use multiple_output = true
- The concept should represent ONE SINGLE item (Article, Employee, Product)
- DO NOT create concepts with plural field names like "item_names", "quantities"
- Instead: use multiple_output = true with singular concept fields like "item_name", "quantity"
- Example: To extract multiple articles, create concept "Article" with fields "item_name", "quantity", then use multiple_output = true

**PipeSequence**: A pipe that executes a sequence of pipes: It needs to reference the pipes it will execute.
The inputs of the PipeSequence should be all the necessary inputs in the below steps, and the inputs that are NOT generated by intermediate steps.
The output should be the concept code of the output of the last step.
- steps: List of pipe codes to execute in order, with result names
- Each step format: {"pipe": "pipe_code", "result": "result_name"}
- Can include batch operations: {"pipe": "pipe_code", "batch_over": "list_input", "batch_as": "item_name", "result": "result_name"}

**PipeParallel**: A pipe that executes a few pipes in parallel. It needs to reference the pipes it will execute.
The inputs of the PipeParallel should be all the necessary inputs in the below steps
The output should be the concept code of the output of the last step.
The results of each pipe will be in the working memory.
- parallels: List of pipes to execute in parallel
- Each parallel format: {"pipe": "pipe_code", "result": "result_name"}

**PipeCondition**: A pipe that based on a specific condition, branches to a specific pipe. You have to explain what the expression of the condition is,
    and what the different pipes are that can be executed based on the condition. It needs to reference the pipes it will execute.
The inputs of the PipeCondition should be all the necessary inputs in the below steps
The output should be the concept code of the output of all the steps, except if the outputs are different, then its "Dynamic"
- expression: Direct expression to evaluate (e.g., "task_result.status")
- pipe_map: Dictionary mapping condition results to pipe codes (e.g., {"completed": "success_pipe", "failed": "failure_pipe"})
- default_pipe_code: Fallback pipe when no conditions match

**PipeBatch**: A pipe that executes a batch of pipes in parallel. It needs to reference the pipe it will execute.
- branch_pipe_code: The pipe code to execute for each item
- input_list_name: Name of the list to iterate over
- input_item_name: Name for individual items within each execution

**PipeImgGen**: A pipe that uses an LLM to generate an image.
The inputs of the PipeImgGen should be: {prompt: ImgGenPrompt}
The output should be the concept code that refines Image.
- img_gen_prompt: Static prompt for image generation (if using static prompt)
- nb_output: Number of images to generate (default 1)
VERY IMPORTANT: IF YOU DECIDE TO CREATE A PIPEIMGEN, YOU ALSO HAVE TO CREATE A PIPELLM THAT WILL WRITE THE PROMPT, AND THAT NEEDS TO PRECEED THE PIPEIMGEN, based on the necessary elements.
THERFORE, the OUTPUT OF THIS PIPELLM should be a VARIABLE NAMED "prompt" that will be used as input for the PipeImgGen.
That means that in the MAIN pipeline, the prompt should NOT be an input. It should be a step that generates the prompt.

**PipeOcr**: A pipe that uses an LLM to extract text from an image.
- The INPUTS of PipeOcr must be either an image or a pdf or a concept which refines one of them.

**PipeFunc**: A pipe that executes a custom Python function.
- function_name: Name of the Python function to call

**PipeCompose**: A pipe that uses Jinja2 to render a template.
- jinja2: Raw Jinja2 template string OR
- jinja2_name: Name reference to a template (use one or the other)
